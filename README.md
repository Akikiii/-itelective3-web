## The Order System
![](images/OrderingSystem.webp)
> #### The "mechanical" aspect of inventory management is ordering systems. These are the software applications that convert our projections, actual orders, safety stock, and order amounts into purchase orders or production orders. Customer expectations and product demands have changed. As customers increasingly drive the buying journey, merchants must adjust quickly to ensure they are delivering a seamless customer experience in a way that is cost-effective for their businesses. This is where an order management system comes in.
### Why do we need an Order System?
> #### An order management system's advantages include merging data resources, stock management, and order tracking into a single, scalable system. Efficiency problems may arise if all of these are managed manually or even offline. 
> A surprising amount of commerce merchants still do not prioritize the digitalization of this process despite all the capabilities and advantages that an order management platform can provide.
